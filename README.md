# Reflex App Containerized with Caddy

## Fast-track your Reflex Python web app into a production-ready Docker container with automatic HTTPS using Caddy.

This project sets up a modern Reflex app (reflex) behind the Caddy web server.
It handles SSL certificates via Let’s Encrypt out of the box and is ready for deployment with minimal friction.

# What’s Inside
	•	Reflex (Python Web Framework): Your app backend + React frontend generator.
	•	Bun (Secretly Required): Manages the JavaScript bits for the frontend. Installed automatically.
	•	Caddy Server: Handles HTTPS, reverse proxying, and automatic certificates like a pro.
	•	Docker Compose: One command to rule them all.

# Quick Start
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reflex-caddy-docker.git
cd reflex-caddy-docker

	2.	Edit your Caddyfile and rxconfig.py:
Make sure the domain and app names match your real deployment.
	3.	Build and Run:

docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up

	4.	Enjoy:
Open https://yourdomain.com and behold your creation.

# Common Pitfalls
	•	Missing reflex command?
You must use uv with the --system flag inside the container. Otherwise, your Reflex install might vanish into a ghost .venv during image building.
	•	Why is Caddy complaining?
Make sure your DNS A-record points to your server IP before Caddy tries to pull certificates.
	•	Frontend not building?
Bun must be installed inside the container — Reflex will handle this automatically if you have curl and unzip.

⸻

# Tech Notes
	•	uv: Ultra-fast Python package manager. Installed globally inside the container.
	•	Bun: Used by Reflex under the hood for frontend building.
	•	No Virtualenvs: Thanks to uv --system, packages are installed into the main Python environment inside the container.
	•	Live SSL: Thanks to Caddy auto-renewing and issuing Let’s Encrypt certificates.

⸻

# Why This Setup?
	•	Minimal moving parts.
	•	Fully automatic HTTPS.
	•	Extremely fast deployments.
	•	No manual SSL certificate setups.
	•	Good enough for quick MVPs or real production with small tweaks.

# Small note

If you find this useful (or you learned what happens when Reflex doesn’t find Bun…), a ⭐️ on GitHub would be awesome!

Would you also like me to give you a perfect short GitHub project description (the tagline below the repo name)?
Example:

“Containerized Reflex web apps with Caddy-powered HTTPS. Fast, clean, production-ready.”

I can suggest a few more if you want!
